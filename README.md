# Churn Exploration: Guided by "Fighting Churn with Data" 📚

Welcome to my repository where I dive into the world of churn, drawing inspiration from Carl Gold's brilliant book, "Fighting Churn with Data".

## What is Churn? 🤔
Churn, especially prevalent in subscription-based businesses, refers to the percentage of customers or subscribers who stop using a product or service within a specific time frame. It's more than just a metric; it represents lost revenue, increased marketing costs, and potential feedback on the product or service quality. Understanding and managing churn is vital for the health and growth of a business.

## My Learning Objectives 🚀
Through this exploration, I aim to:
- Grasp the fundamental concepts and nuances of churn.
- Understand various methodologies and techniques to analyse churn.
- Apply practical solutions and strategies to combat and reduce churn.
- Deepen my knowledge by adapting and experimenting with the teachings from the book.
